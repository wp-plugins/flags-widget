== Description ==

A simple plug-in that displays flag icons.

This plug-in does not provide a way to translate posts directly, but offen you do not want a direct translation of posts. Still you want to add flag icons that link to other language versions of your blog.

After installation of this plug-in a new widget will be added that you can use to display such flag icons on your blog. A set of flag icons is included, but if you want to use your own images that's possible, too.
